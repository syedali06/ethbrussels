##RainToken

RainTokens is an innovative hackathon project designed to reward users with tokens whenever it rains in their location. By integrating real-time weather data with a blockchain-based token distribution system, RainTokens aims to promote outdoor awareness and incentivize people to engage with weather patterns in a fun and interactive way. Users can redeem these tokens for various rewards, such as discounts at local businesses, access to exclusive events, or even donations to environmental causes. The goal of RainTokens is to create a positive impact by encouraging people to appreciate and interact with their environment in a meaningful way.

RainTokens leverages a combination of weather APIs, blockchain technology, and smart contracts to function seamlessly. Here's an overview of the tech stack used:

- Weather API Integration: The project uses OpenWeatherMap to fetch real-time weather data. This data is used to determine whether it's raining in the user's location.
- Geolocation Services: To pinpoint the user's exact location, geolocation services are utilized, ensuring accurate weather data retrieval.
- Blockchain and Smart Contracts: The core of RainTokens is built on Ethereum. Smart contracts are used to automate the distribution of tokens whenever the weather conditions meet the criteria (i.e., when it rains).
- Tokenomics: Custom tokens are created and managed on the blockchain, adhering to standard token protocols (e.g., ERC-20). These tokens are issued to users based on the smart contract's logic.


Unfortunately time was not enough to complete it but I learned a lot of things about Hardhat during this project.
